# Smart-College-Attendance-Analytics
## Project Overview
This project analyzes student attendance and academic performance to identify **high-risk** and **low-risk** students. End-to-end data analytics project using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI to identify high-risk students.
The analysis helps colleges take early action for students with low attendance or poor marks.

---

## Problem Statement
- Track student attendance and marks
- Calculate attendance percentage and average marks
- Identify students at **High Risk** (low attendance or low marks)
- Build an interactive dashboard for decision-making

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data storage, joins, aggregations, risk logic
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and verification
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard & visualization
- **Python (Pandas)** – Risk calculation & validation (optional)
- **GitHub** – Version control & project sharing

---

## Dataset Description
Located in the `data/` folder:

- `students.csv` → Student master details  
- `attendance.csv` → Daily attendance records  
- `marks.csv` → Subject-wise marks  

---

## SQL Analysis
Located in the `sql/` folder:

- Database and table creation
- Attendance percentage calculation
- Average marks calculation
- High-risk vs Low-risk student identification

File: `college_analysis.sql`

---

## Power BI Dashboard
Located in the `powerbi/` folder:

### Dashboard Features
- Total Students Count
- High Risk vs Low Risk Students
- Department-wise Risk Distribution
- Attendance vs Marks Scatter Analysis
- Interactive filters (Department, Year, Risk Status)

 File: `college_dashboard.pbix`

---

## Key Insights
- Students with attendance below **75%** or marks below **50** are classified as **High Risk**
- Some departments have higher risk concentration
- Attendance has a strong impact on academic performance

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**:
- Data cleaning → SQL analysis → Excel validation → Power BI dashboard

It is suitable for **Data Analyst / Business Analyst fresher roles**.
